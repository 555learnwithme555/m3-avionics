***DC/DC Converter***

- Since external temp monitoring is not needed and shorted to GND, set the UT_FAULT_LIMIT to –275°C, IOUT_CAL_GAIN_TC set to zero and the UT_FAULT_RE-SPONSE to ignore.

- Choose Schottky diode to carry 1A

- Boost capacitors are 100x total input (gate) capacitance of topside MOSFETs

- large capacitors need to have low ESR (particularly the 100uF one. Get this: 1735535(FAR))

- Inductors need to carry above 4A of peak current, pref 5A

- Rsense at 10mO are still a shot in the dark

- Freq of operation will be 575kHz
