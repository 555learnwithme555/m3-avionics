# Martlet 3 Data Logger Stack

For overall BOM see: http://bit.ly/1YytYK4

x1 Temperature Sensor Board:
- LTC2983 10 Channel fancy box.
- 9 Thermocouples w/ Cold junction compensation.
- SPI over data logger stack interconnect (x4 Pins) plus interrupt.
- On board 18-pin connector (2 Pins per Thermocouple) connects to a wiring harness which passes through cutouts in below boards and breaks out to 9x 2-Pin in line connectors for thermocouples.

x2 Strain Gauge Boards:
- Analogue front end w/ AD8226.
- 3 Strain Gauges per PCB â€“ 6 Total.
- Connection to ADC Inputs over data logger stack interconnect (x6 Pins).
- Per PCB 3 on board 4-pin connectors (1 per Gauge) connect to a wiring harness which passes through cutouts in below boards and breaks out to 6x 4-Pin in line connectors for strain gauges.

x1 Pressure Sensor Board:
- Absolute pressure sensors with mV Output to be placed externally.
- Simple RC filter connects sensor outputs to ADC over data logger stack interconnect (x5 Pins).
- Maximum 5 external Pressure Sensors .
- On board 10-pin connector to a cable which passes through cutouts in below boards and attaches to the external sensors through a wiring harness in a similar manner to the above.

x1 Main Board:
